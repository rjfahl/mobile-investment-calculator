# Mobile Investment Calculator

There are a handful of calculations I like to be able to make without the headache of doing it on a calculator
or searching or an existing tool online, so I've been running them in a local console application.

I decided it would be nice to have these available to me on my phone, so I put together a quick .NET MAUI application
to satisfy the itch and explore a part of the .NET landscape that I haven't used before.

## Current Investment Calculators
- Compound Interest Calculator
    - GIVEN an initial investment, monthly contribution, interest rate, and time span
    - WHEN I calculate the value of the investment at the end of the time span
    - THEN I should see the total value and the high/low variance values of the investment
- Business Investment Calculator
    - GIVEN an initial investment, desired return rate, inflation rate, time span, and projected company earnings
    - THEN I should see the total value of the investment at the end of the given time span
    - AND I should see the percentage (%) of company ownership that I need to achieve the desired returns
